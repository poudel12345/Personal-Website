# Intro

Hey, I am Praful Poudel currently studying at Wentworth Institute of Technology. I am an aspiring software engineer, and I plan to have an impact in the current world with the skills that I have learned. 

# Currently
I am a junior at Wentworth, and I am looking for an internship position as a software engineering intern or web developer intern. I am also actively applying for the summer intern positions. Currently, I am also working on few projects of my own. I support my family while I study so any paid internship opportunities would be amazing. 

# Some history

- I only got my own computer after my high school, although I'd camp on my friends house to play RoadRash.

- I went to a religious school where we had to pray two times a day, meditate and learn Sanskrit.

- My parents got married early, so they could not complete their education which makes me the first generation college student. 

- I loved sports, but I got hurt a lot and most of the time it was my head.

- We had multiples trees in our home that is probably the reason why I draw my inspiration from nature.

- I tried to make my own airplane at a Science Exhibition but unfortunately the motor was too heavy. I always tried to do the hardest projects. 

Hope I can tell you more about me when we talk in person.
